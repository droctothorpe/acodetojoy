Hi.

I'm Alex.

Like a button-mashing younger sibling who kicks butt at a fighting game without actually knowing how to play, when I press keys at random, good things occassionally happen. Given enough time, [even monkeys can write Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem). 

I work on a platform for distributed ML at Capital One's Center for Machine Learning.

I live in the NYC metro area with my wife (I can't read "my wife" in anything other than Borat voice) and two awesome ~~pets~~ kiddoes.
