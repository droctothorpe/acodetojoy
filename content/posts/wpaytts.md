I attend ~~too many~~ a lot of demos.

Over the years, I've observed that engineers have a tendency to jump into
complex solutions without providing sufficient context first.

When confronted with this approach, audiences often disengage, especially people
leaders who can be several steps removed from technical implementation
details.

It's frustrating to see a great solution not get the reaction it deserves.

Here's the thing. Generally speaking, people have a low tolerance for
complexity. Senior people leaders, in particular, are already drinking from a
firehose and often struggling to somehow tame and orchestrate an overwhelming
level of complexity.

The key to making complexity engaging is justification. If you take a few
minutes at the start of your demo to justify the subsequent complexity, your
audience will be significantly more tolerant and perhaps even genuinely
interested.

How do you justify complexity? It's simple. Start your demos by addressing the
following question:

**What problem are you trying to solve?**

WPAYTTS.

Someone should make silicone bracelets with that or something.

There's a directly proportional relationship between (1) how effectively and comprehensively you describe the
problem, and (2) how interested in the solution (and willing to to grapple with complexity) your
audience is.

Demos are often time-constrained. Sometimes you have to cut corners. Do not cut
this one. Always describe the problem.

You can provide additional details downstream. If you've adequately justified
the solution by describing the severity of the problem it's intended to address,
people will inquire about implementation details organically.

You can use this simple outline as a starting point:

- The problem
- The solution
- The impact

The majority of demos I attend spend 95% of their allotted time on the solution.
A distribution that approaches an even split between these three phases will
often be more effective.

I often engage in RDD, rage-driven development (as opposed to resume-driven
development). Consequently, I tend to be _intimately_ familiar with (and furious
about), the _problem_. I find complaining about it at length to a more or less
captive (and interested) audience oddly cathartic, and there's no better way to
whet their appetites for a solution.
