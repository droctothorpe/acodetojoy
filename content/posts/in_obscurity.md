I recently read this remarkable anecdote about Isaac Newton in the refereshingly
irreverent _A Short History of Nearly Everything_ by Bill Bryson:

> As a student, frustrated by the limitations of conventional mathematics, he
> [Newton] invented an entirely new form, the calculus, but then told no one
> about it for **twenty-seven years**. In like manner, he did work in optics
> that transformed our understanding of light and laid the foundation for the
> science of spectroscopy, and again chose not to share the results for three
> decades.

Emphasis mine. Twenty-seven years! That's an incomprehensible level of reticence
in an era in which people can't eat a sandwich, let alone invent Calculus,
without tweeting about it. I tweet, therefore I am.

That got me thinking about other creatives who withheld the fruits of their
labor from the world at large.

> Kafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and

No one--_no one_--would know about Franz Kafka if Max Brod did not defy his
dying wishes.

Then there's Henry Darger:

His work belongs to a category of obscure, and often post-humously discovered,
[outsider art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art).

I wonder to what extent instantaneous "publication" has adversely impacted our
ability to work on something, in obscurity, _for it's own sake_.

What would you create _even if no one ever saw it_?

That's an interesting, clarifying question isn't it?

I'm troubled by my inability to answer it.

Newton, Kafka, and Darger certainly could.
